<hr>

Website for landing and presentation of an interior design company. Fully responsive. There is a gallery of projects with the ability to filter by category. The feedback form allows the owner to receive messages from users by email, made using a third-party service. Built-in google maps.

<hr>

The project is not labor intensive, although it allows solving certain business problems. Clients can view ready-made design projects and contact the manager if they wish to get advice, discuss details and place an order.
